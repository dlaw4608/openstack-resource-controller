# Creation and deletion dependencies

## Step 00

Create {{ .Kind }}s referencing non-existing resources. Each {{ .Kind }} is dependent on other non-existing resource. Verify that the {{ .Kind }}s are waiting for the needed resources to be created externally.

## Step 01

Create the missing dependencies and make and verify all the {{ .Kind }}s are available.

## Step 02

Delete all the dependencies and check that ORC prevents deletion since there is still a resource that depends on them.

## Step 03

Delete the {{ .Kind }}s and validate that all resources are gone.
