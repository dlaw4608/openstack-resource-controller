# Check dependency handling for imported {{ .Kind }}

## Step 00

Import a {{ .Kind }} that references other imported resources. The referenced imported resources have no matching resources yet.
Verify the {{ .Kind }} is waiting for the dependency to be ready.

## Step 01

Create a {{ .Kind }} matching the import filter, except for referenced resources, and verify that it's not being imported.

## Step 02

Create the referenced resources and a {{ .Kind }} matching the import filters.

Verify that the observed status on the imported {{ .Kind }} corresponds to the spec of the created {{ .Kind }}.

## Step 03

Delete the referenced resources and check that ORC does not prevent deletion. The OpenStack resources still exist because they
were imported resources and we only deleted the ORC representation of it.

## Step 04

Delete the {{ .Kind }} and validate that all resources are gone.
