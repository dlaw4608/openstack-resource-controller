# Import {{ .Kind }}

## Step 00

Import a {{ .PackageName }}, matching all of the available filter's fields, and verify it is waiting for the external resource to be created.

## Step 01

Create a {{ .PackageName }} which name is a superstring of the one specified in the import filter, and otherwise matching the filter, and verify that it's not being imported.

## Step 02

Create a {{ .PackageName }} matching the filter and verify that the observed status on the imported {{ .PackageName }} corresponds to the spec of the created {{ .PackageName }}.
Also verify that the created {{ .PackageName }} didn't adopt the one which name is a superstring of it.
